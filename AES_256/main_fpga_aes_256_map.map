    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:    116
      Number with same-slice register load:    116
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,473 out of  11,662   12%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        92 out of  23,324    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,517
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,244 out of   4,517   27%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              58 out of  93,296    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
